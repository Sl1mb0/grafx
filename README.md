# sl1mb0/grafx

This is just a collection of all of my graphics related things.

### hello_world 
 This was a project to teach myself the basics of image rendering.
 The graphics equivalent of `hello world` is generating an rgb gradient, which is what this project does.

### rules
 This is a project used to create the various rules found in cellular automata.
 Currently the only implemented rule is rule 30.
 
 In particular, rule 30 is one of the most well known rules in cellular automata. 
 This program generates an image using rule 30, tinted with and rgb gradient. 
 Much of the code in `hello_world` is used.
